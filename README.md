# A Neural Field-Based Approach for View Computation & Data Exploration in 3D Urban Environments

This repository contains the implementation of the approaches introduced in the work **A Neural Field-Based Approach for
View Computation & Data Exploration in 3D Urban Environments** by Stefan Cobeli, Kazi Shahrukh Omar, Rodrigo Valen√ßa, Nivan Ferreira and Fabio Miranda.  

The main method encodes visibility distributions in 3d environments(e.g., towards buildings, trees, water, or sky) and supports direct queries (computing visibility from a given viewpoint) as well as inverse queries (finding viewpoints that match desired conditions).

## Installation & Setup

We recommend using **Anaconda** with Python `3.9.13`.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StefanCobeli/Visibility_Encoder.git
   git clone https://github.com/StefanCobeli/visibility-data-generator.git
   cd Visibility_Encoder

2.	Create the environment:

    ```bash
    conda create -n Visibility_Encoder python=3.9.13

3.	Run the setup script:

    ```bash
    ./run.sh

## Usage

After running `run.sh`, you can access the interface and compute visibility distributions at 
      
      http://localhost:5173



## Data & Meshes:

The visibility dataset can be found at:

    utils/assets/data/locations.csv

The 3D models can be found at:

     ../visibility-data-generator/static/data/NYC/collada_model/
